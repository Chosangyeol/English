# Global Illumination



Learn about the available precomputed and dynamic global illumination options available.



Global illumination (also called indirect lighting and indirect illumination) simulates lighting interactions with geometry and material surfaces to add realistic lighting to your scenes and projects.



This simulation also takes into account absorption and reflectiveness of the materials with which it interacts.



Simulating the way light behaves in 3D worlds is handled in one of two ways: using real-time lighting methods that support light movement and interaction of dynamic lights, or by using precomputed (or baked) lighting information that gets stored in textures applied to geometric surfaces.



Unreal Engine provides both these ways of lighting scenes and they are not exclusive to one another as they can be seamlessly blended between one another.



These are some of the highlights of each system to help you understand their usage and capabilities:
