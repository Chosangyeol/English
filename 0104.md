The History of Computer

In 1944, The MARK 1 composed of mechanical and eletrical components is designed to perform simple arthmetic data. And the next medels such as ENIAC and UNIVAC are built. Especially, the UNIVAC was the first commercial computer that was used by the U.S. Bureau of Census. However, the vacuum tubes used in those machines generate enormous heat that shortens the life of tubes.
